A Selenium web scraper that scrapes Booking.com.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this scraper, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:

    - Python (recommended version 3.8 or above)
    - An IDE or text editor configured with Python installed (e.g. PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
    - The pip package manager (you can install this by running "python get-pip.py" in the command line)
    - The selenium package (you can install this by running "pip install selenium" in the command line)
    - A driver for launching the automation (we will use chromedriver.exe)
